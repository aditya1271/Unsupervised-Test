# Ideas
- Track eyes , use geometry to figure out head facing direction
- Use CNN based facial keypoints and pose to pose difference to figure out head movement
- Also can use object detection to detect items that can be used for cheating

## Main FrameWorks
- OpenCV -> For Processing on Vedio and images
- TF , Keras -> For Deep Learning using facial keypoints

## Research on Ideas
1. Tracking eyes 
  - [Haar-Cascade-Approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvfF9CDzn1s&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge)
  - Advantages
    - Required Less Computer power
  - Disadvantage
    - accuracy is questionable!
2. Facial Keypoints
  - [Facial-Keypoint-Approach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vC3bTziLRTA&ab_channel=NeuralDimension)
3. Object Detection
  - Fairly simple!
  - Not know wheather it will be helpful or not
